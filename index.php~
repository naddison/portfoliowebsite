      	<h1>Welcome!</h1>
    	<p>My name is Nikolas Addison Harris and this is my website. Its simple aesthetic can tell you that I am foremost a programmer and not a graphics wizard. I currently attend Georgian College in Barrie, Ontario for a Programming Analyst CO-OP Diploma, however my experience and passion for technology predates my academic career. </p>
    	<p>I remember when my father brought home our first family computer; my first OS being MS-DOS. First game being hooked on was Doofus. Then came building my first website, gaming desktop, application, and I have been learning ever since.  Technology is a hard term to define. I can never put my finger on what technology is, but I define myself by my passion for it. </p>
	<p>I created this space so that I may showcase my work on the many projects I have undertaken and am currently working on. I hope that you while exploring my corner of the web you may learn something or have something to teach me. No one is ever done learning and I love making new friends with the same passion I have for coding and hardware. Check out my contact page on how to reach me.</p>
   	 <h2>Enjoy!</h2>
