					<h3>Why consider me?</h3>
					<p>As a technician I understand that I offer a service and I enjoy sharing my passion through learning and educating others in its use. Clear communication is important to excellent customer service. I strive for perfection while keeping deadlines and efficiency in mind.</p>
                    <p>At Pizza Hut I served as an on-call level 1 technician, escalating problems I could not solve to an off-site call center. I have learned the value of speed in solving technical problems as speed is key to the food service industry.</p>
                    <p>Wonderland taught me how to work in a larger team solving technical problems on a bigger scale. Wonderland also introduced me to the complexity of inter-department communication, impressing even more the importance of clear and concise communication between people.</p>
                    <p>Above all I am reliable and to be successful you must surround yourself with a crew you can rely on.</p>
                    <p>If I don’t know it, I learn it.</p>
